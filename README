Dark Matter
============

Dark Matter is an app for Android that:
- Disables the camera
- Disables all keyguard widgets
- Runs a script when an incorrect password is entered from the lock screen


### Setup project in Eclipse

1. Download and install ADT Bundle (http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/bundle.html) or install Eclipse/ADT separately
2. Put the Device Admin source code somewhere
3. In Eclipse choose File-menu > Import > Android > Existing Android Code Into Workspace
4. Browse to the source code folder
5. Check the box and click Finish


### Code

The code has three classes:

- AdminReceiver.java
Handler for the events received from Android
- ScriptRunner.java
Helper class for copying the script to disk and running it
- MainActivity.java
Not used anymore, but might be useful for testing


### Run the project in debug mode

1. Right click the project in the Package Explorer and select Run As > Android Application
The app will be built and signed with your default debug keys


### Build the release version

1. Right click the project in the Package Explorer and select Export > Android > Export Android Application
2. Click Next
3. Create a new key store or use a previous one and enter password/passwords
When you create a new key store make sure you keep it safe (backup) and make sure you remember the password.
4. Follow the rest of the instructions in the wizard


### Miscelaneous

- The script is located in res/raw/script.sh
- String values can be changed in res/values/strings.xml
- The strings can be localized if necessary using alternative resources (http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/localization.html#using-framework)
- You can't mix debug version and release version. When switching from one version to another you need to uninstall the app first.
- When you uppdate the app on your phone, the app has to be signed with the same key as last time.
- There are some TODOs in the code that may be considered for future versions of the app.
- If necessary you can obfuscate the java code using pro guard (http://developer.android.com/tools/help/proguard.html)
